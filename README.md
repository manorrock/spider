# Piranha Smart

Th Piranha Smart project delivers you with an intelligent web application that
you can use as a load balancer, an API gateway, an SSL terminator, a web 
application router, a rate limiter, or a circuit breaker.

## How does it work?

The core of Piranha Smart is the SmartFilter that reads a configuration file 
that allows you to customize what Piranha Smart does with a request.
