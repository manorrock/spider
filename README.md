# Manorrock Spider

[![build](https://github.com/manorrock/spider/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/manorrock/spider/actions/workflows/build.yml)

The Manorrock Spider project delivers you with an intelligent web application
that you can use as a load balancer, an API gateway, an SSL terminator, a web 
application router, a rate limiter, or a circuit breaker.

## How does it work?

The core of Manorrock Spider is the SmartFilter that reads a configuration file 
that allows you to customize what Manorrock Spider does with a request.
